tt-fort
=======

Fortran computing core of the TT-Toolbox
Right now, it is not easy to use as a standalone project.

It also includes two slightly customized libraries:

1) PRIMME code  http://www.cs.wm.edu/~andreas/software/
2) Expokit code http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/

for doing fast local solvers in eigenvalue and dynamical problems.
